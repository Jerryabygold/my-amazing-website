        I am the head oo and not the tail oo
        that's who i am that's what i am.
        I am above oo and not beneath oo
        that where i am that's where i stand (3x).

        I am moving forward nothing can stop me
        every mountain before me are crumbling down.
        i'm expanding on every size oo 
        no more limit in jesus name(2x).
        
        Forward everyday never going back 
        higher i will go never going down
        his favour be on my labour(4x).
